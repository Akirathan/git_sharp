# GitSharp
Simplified multi-platform implementation of Git in C#.

## Build

## Architecture
Is based on existing Git architecture.
For some reference about git architecture see Git Internals in [Git Pro Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain)
and [Hackernnon - understanding Git data model](https://hackernoon.com/https-medium-com-zspajich-understanding-git-data-model-95eb16cc99f5)

Following text will mention some Git Internals principles that are used in GitSharp solution
and link those principles with some of the classes.

## Tests

## Usage
Supported commands are subset of existing Git commands - for more information see Git documentation.
